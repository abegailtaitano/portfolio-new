Greetings human...or bot, a little bit about me. I'm just a girl who is on a journey of becoming the best Software Engineer I can be. I love learning from other humans and I have a passion for helping/teaching others as well. I truly believe the best method on being successful in this career is being open minded to all the knowledge and feedback you gain from others. We are all in the same team with diverse backgrounds who have the same goal, and that is to keep on learning and growing our skills.
